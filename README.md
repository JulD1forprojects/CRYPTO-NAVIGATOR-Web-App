## üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Project Development Approach

<ol>
<li>Decided on visuals and types of components that needed to be developed. </li>
<li>Designed banner with a simple text & image. </li>
<li>Wrapped the whole app into a theme (with Theme Context and Theme Wrapper). </li>
<li>Wrapped the app in the Theme Wrapper in main.jsx. </li>
<li>Started working on a navbar. Navbar is meant to contain Toggle (toggleDark component) to switch between light and dark theme. </li>
<li>Main functionality work: worked on Table & Coins component to fetch and render API data (with Axios).</li>
<li>Developed Search field and Clear search functionality to ensure user could focus on individual crypto coin(s) only. </li>
<li>Pagination component was the last part of development process, after the rest of functionality was ensured to be in place. Pagination is meant to limit number of crypto data rows in a table (from 100 to 10 per page) to complement search functionality and make user experience more friendly.</li>
<li>UI and UX was achieved via Bootstrap and React Bootstrap dependencies and CSS selectors.</li>
<li>Web App Responsiveness (different screen fit) comes from CSS @media queries.</li>
